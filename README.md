Multiple Radio Stream Client.

Written in HTML and Javascript, with a PHP Proxy for cross origin requests.

UI/Design was an after thought. (Yes I know its shit :sweat:)

#TODO
* Extract Meta data from the audio file instead of using server status?
* Make a decent UI :blush:
* Album Artwork from song name? Library?
* Add support for Flash streams (like Frag Radio)
